            The Vasa Museum is widely considered the most visited museum in all of Scandinavia. Inside the museum is a warship from the early 1600s that went about 1400 yards into the harbor and then sank. In the late 1950s the ship was raised out of the harbor and placed into the museum. I have actually been to this museum and it is really cool.
